This Python code takes an IPv4 address with CIDR notation and calculates the subnet address, broadcast address, subnet mask, CIDR notation, and number of usable hosts.
It uses Pythonâ€™s built-in ipaddress module and requires no external libraries.
Run the script, enter the IP with prefix, and instantly get the network details.
